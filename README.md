# Verses: Bauhaus

A contemplative Bible verse app with Bauhaus-inspired geometric animations.

## Design

- Black and cream color palette
- Sliding tile animations that form geometric compositions
- Quotes appear in the negative space as tiles settle
- Typography: Jost (open-source Futura revival)

## Features

- Opening animation: tiles part like curtains to reveal first verse
- Tap to transition to next verse with chain-reaction tile movement
- Quote fade synced to tile animation timing

## Setup

1. Create a new Flutter project:
   ```
   flutter create verses_bauhaus
   ```

2. Replace `lib/main.dart` with the `main.dart` from this repo

3. Add google_fonts to `pubspec.yaml`:
   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     google_fonts: ^6.1.0
   ```

4. Run:
   ```
   flutter run
   ```

## Part of the Verses Family

This is one of several contemplative scripture apps, each with its own aesthetic:

- **Verses: Bauhaus** (this one) — Bible, geometric minimalism
- **Verses: Cathedral** — Catholic texts, stained glass aesthetic
- **Verses: Terminal** — Bhagavad Gita, hacker/code aesthetic  
- **Verses: Sumi-e** — Eastern texts, ink wash aesthetic
- **Verses: Night Sky** — Psalms, nocturnal contemplation
- And more...
